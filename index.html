            <h3>Mornin&apos;!</h3>
            <p>
                I am Jasmine Rose, an artist, writer, and raconteur.
                I am a traveler, a homeschooler, a writer, an artist,
                and a Christ follower. As a kid, I lived in many
                different places, ranging from the tiny town of Candor,
                New York, all the way across the continent to bustling San
                Francisco, California. After migrating all over the US,
                our family finally moved back home to Nebraska, smack-dab
                in the middle of the friendly Midwest. As a homeschooler,
                I found that I really love to learn. Schooling included
                trips to the zoo, Wrap-Up Rap, helping out in the garden,
                and everything in between. I really enjoyed the relaxed,
                fun learning environment that my home was. As an extrovert,
                I love people. Two of my best friends and I share a love for
                art and music. My sister and I often bring instruments over
                to their house, and we just jam together. All of us love
                playing board games, and it remains one of our main modes of
                hanging out. As a Christian, I love my Lord and Savior Jesus.
                I love my church, because no matter how different we all are,
                what opinions we don&apos;t share, we all have that one thing
                in common. Because of my faith, I&apos;ve learned to gain
                wisdom from my past, cherish today, and have hope for the future.

            <h3>The Greatest Storyteller</h3>
            <p>
                As a storyteller, the story of the Bible inspires me.
                It tells of a people who is hopelessly corrupted and
                enslaved and can never earn their own freedom, and it
                tells of a King who sacrifices everything just to buy
                it back. It is the greatest story of love, loss, pain,
                justice, and redemption that ever has or ever will be
                told. It is the archetype of stories, the tale every 
                other tale echoes, the narrative that is etched into 
                the core of every human being.
            </p>

            <h3>Glorious Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                My aim is to write great stories. Stories that champion
                good ethics and morals, like those championed in the Bible.
                My goal is not to preach, nor to shove some agenda down my
                reader&apos;s throats, but to give them something to think
                about. There is a place for critical thinking as we consume
                media, and the media we consume likewise should give us ideas
                over which to ponder. I build every character I write around
                a core question, which defines how and why they interact with
                their environment in the way that they do. Find these questions,
                and ponder them alongside the characters as you read.
